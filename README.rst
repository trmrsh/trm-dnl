trm.dnl is a half-baked Python package to 1D data analysis

Pre-requisites for installation:

Python:
  numpy, scipy, astropy -- you've probably got these
  trm.subs -- get from github
  trm.sla -- get from github

Think that's it, although the odd script might rely on something more exotic,
but you probably won't need them.
